# International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) Data Analysis

## Data in Repository

The data for this project is located in the `IMO_data` folder within this repository. It consists of three CSV files:

1. `country_results.csv`: Contains country-level results for each IMO.
2. `individual_results.csv`: Contains individual participant results.
3. `timeline.csv`: Contains historical information about each IMO event.

## Metadata

### Data Source
The data was obtained from the TidyTuesday project, specifically from the week 39 dataset of 2024. Original data comes from the International Mathematical Olympiad official records, scraped from https://www.imo-official.org/.

### Data Description
- `country_results.csv`: Contains year, country, team sizes, scores for each problem, total score, country rank, and awards for each participating country.
- `individual_results.csv`: Contains year, contestant name, country, scores for each problem, total score, individual rank, and award for each participant.
- `timeline.csv`: Contains information about each IMO event, including year, host country and city, number of participating countries and contestants, and event dates.

### Date Range
The dataset covers IMO events from 1959 to 2024.

## Data Hosting
The data files are hosted directly in this GitHub repository in the `IMO_data` folder. No external hosting is required.

## Relevance of the Data

This dataset is highly relevant for several reasons:

1. **Historical Trends in Mathematics Education**: With data spanning from 1959 to 2024, it allows for analysis of long-term trends in high-level mathematics education across different countries.

2. **Gender Representation in STEM**: The inclusion of gender data enables research into the changing landscape of gender participation in high-level mathematics competitions over time.

3. **International Education Comparisons**: The country-level data facilitates comparisons of mathematical education systems and talent development across different nations.

4. **Performance Analysis**: The detailed problem scores allow for in-depth analysis of strengths and weaknesses in different areas of mathematics across countries and individuals.

5. **Team Dynamics**: Data on team composition and performance can be used to study how team size and structure impact overall country performance.

6. **Award Distribution**: Information on medals and honorable mentions provides insights into the distribution of top performances across countries and over time.

7. **Geographical and Cultural Factors**: The host country and city data allow for exploration of how geographical and cultural factors might influence participation and performance.

This dataset is particularly valuable for researchers in education, data scientists interested in competition analytics, and policymakers looking to understand and improve mathematics education globally. It offers a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of international mathematics competitions and their role in identifying and nurturing mathematical talent worldwide.
